A review on a product can not only drive the sale of the item, but positive and negative reviews can position your product higher or lower in the a customer's search.  This makes determining the sentiment of a review important as well as knowing which words drive that sentiment.  The goal here is to identify these words and help sellers to suggest keywords to influencers to use in reviews to maximize review effectiveness."
